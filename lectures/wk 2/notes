Primitive objects (Strings, Integer, Float, Boolean):
1.	Strings
tic= "QAN.AX"
tic='QAN.AX'
tic='''QAN.AX'''
tic="""QAN.AX"""
usually will need to use triple quotes when maybe youre printing a sentence
x='''John said, "let's go together".'''
print(x)

2.	Integer  Float (casting)
Usually when dividing eg 4/2 python will change the ans to a float
f=0.2+0.2+0.2
print(f)
0.6000000000000001
print(f==0.6)
False
However,
f=0.2+0.2
print(f)
0.4
*need to be really careful when dealing with floats
3.	Booleans (==)
Namespaces
Deleting variable: del (variable name)
When you name the variable as key words in python
Modules and Packages
Modules – any file containing python modules
Data structures (List, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries)
1.List:
-	using [ ] square brackets eg lst=[a,b,c] OR using () eg lst=list(a,b,c)
-	Zero-based Indexing; ending index is not included
-	Slicing: lst (Start:End)
Eg     lst = [ “a”,”b”,”c”, “d”, “e” , “f”]
                0     1   2     3      4     5
               -6    -5   -4   -3     -2     -1  0
         To get b and c only
         print (lst[1:3])   OR
         lens(lst)
        print (lst [-5:-3])

lst=[1,"string",True,None,True]
lst.remove(True)
print(lst)
in this case, python prints ['string', True, None, True]
as True is 1; False is 0  thus 1 is removed from the list.

2.Turples (will automatically remove duplicate)
Eg t=(“word”, 5 , False)

3.Dictionary
If youre finding the key that is not avaliabel in the table, python will just add the new key and value into the table.

List sets and objects are mutable
