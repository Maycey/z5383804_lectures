Python always need to import yfinance first
None -> bring to todays date
With or without the red code (ignore_tz), the result should be the same

Variable name in python
-	They are case sensitive.
-	For the starting, can only include: Letter or underscore

a1=1
a1=1+2
a1=a1+5
what we are trying to do: variable = expression
answer is 8
as python only run top down
if you change the third line to A1, you get an undefined error.
a1=1
a1=1+2
print(a1)
a1=A1+5
print(a1)

if this python will only print 3 and everything after the error print error
if print(a1==1)
False
== basically checks whether the variable and expression are equal
Python sees this as string
a2="2"+"3"
print(a2)
23

a2="2"+"3"+5  or   a2= 5+ "2"+"3"
print(a2)
type ERROR
